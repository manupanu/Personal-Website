   bio = """I'm Manuel Anrig, born in '97 and raised on two wheels. 
   From soldering PCBs to shredding trails, my life is a mashup of tech tinkering and bike obsession. 
   After an apprenticeship as an electronics technician and years in PCB design, I swapped the soldering iron 
   for a torque wrench and chased my passion into the bike world. 
   Now, at Specialized, I get to blend both—working on E-Bike System Quality by day and hacking on side projects 
   or racing bikes on the weekend. This site is my corner for blog posts, code experiments, and ride results."""
